# A-review-of-digital-cytometry-methods

This repository contains the following scripts:

TumorDecon_Functions.py: python functions to obtain correlations between estimated and ground truth fractions and functions to make plots for comparison between digital cytometry methods.

Simulation_results.ipynb: python notebook for plotting of the results from simulation data with the use of both LM22 and LM6.

PBMC_results.ipynb: python notebook for plotting of the results from PBMC data with the use of both LM22 and LM6.

Wholeblood_results.ipynb: python notebook for plotting of the results from wholeblood data with the use of both LM22 and LM6.

Mixture data, signature matrices, gene sets and ground truth fractions are in ‘Data’ folder.

Output fractions from digital cytometry methods are in ‘Results’ folder.
